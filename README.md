# Speech_to_Text_Survey_Analysis
Analyzing text extracted from conducted customer surveys on the topic of status during valentines day. The goal was to translate large volumes of the unstructured text into quantitative data to look at insights, trends, and patterns from the answers. Frameworks such as word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis, n-grams, correlograms as well as Naive Bayes and LTA predictive models were used to predict whether or not someone was single or taken for valentines day. An interactive report with insights was created with the
Shiny App written in R.
